# Mars Rover Innovation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Mars Rover Innovation Project repository! Our innovative idea is poised to revolutionize spatial exploration, particularly on Mars, addressing key limitations observed in previous rover deployments.

## Solution Overview

Our groundbreaking solution leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance rover capabilities. The primary focus areas of our solution are:

### 1. Terrain Mapping

To overcome challenges in navigating Mars' terrain, we employ cameras on the rover and helicopter to detect rocks in the environment. In addition to radar and lidar sensors, AI is utilized to enhance rock detection. We implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) technology for efficient object detection. Check out the [code for the YOLO model](https://github.com/Sofiene-Sellami/RockDetector) that we trained. For a demonstration of the model in action, view the [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLqH66jy-Bm6sbpkJTME6XQz__wu2S3t/view?usp=sharing).

### 2. Dust mitigation

To mitigate dust and debris accumulation on the wheels, we employ vibration techniques, including electrostatic repulsion. Witness the effectiveness of this mechanism in our [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmFrBWHSqA8).
